## Preface

You may have noticed the previous post about COVID-19 has been renamed, and
that there are now button(s) in each of the COVID-19 posts. I figured I
should document all of these changes and personal experience that took place
during the pandemic, especially as a Taiwanese.

This change also means that I'll try to be more thorough with my posts in
this series, whereas the previous one was more or less written more of a
vent piece than anything.

## Experiences with WFH

Those who have worked from home during the lockdown, especially those who
have been doing it for well over a couple of seasons, will probably tell you
WFH is both excellent and awful for your overall mental well-being and or
productivity at the same time. Starting some time around May, we've been
instructed to work from home lest an outbreak occurs at the company.

This move made sense, especially due to the nature of our job, where working at
an office really isn't necessary. As long as we have access to the internal
networks still, we can basically from anywhere with an active internet
connection. I can still access the internal work chat, the file servers,
issue trackers, and more. Besides, that also means I get to use my 3900X
desktop at home, which is far better than my highly underpowered XPS 13 when
I need to work on far more power-intensive projects.

The problem with all this? Without the workplace peer pressure, I find
myself slacking a little bit more than usual. I might get up a little bit
later, have a longer lunch break than I should, taking longer breaks, etc.
With that being said, I still fill that 8-hour a day quota that our
workplace expects - just into more spread out chunks. Which... unfortunately
means the line between work and personal stuff becomes *far* blurrier.

Occasionally I'd get work duty outside of my usual work hours that I feel
the need to fulfill or doing work stuff during the weekends. Of course, none
of this was obligatory, and my company did not ask me to do any of this, but
it simply becomes a habit to work on whatever when you spend all the time in
front of the same computer doing both personal and work stuff all day.

After getting back to work however, I've become much more focused instead of slacking off every now and then thankfully. At the time of writing this draft, mostly all of us have gone back to the office for work. While commute is still a bit bleh, now I have another reason to bust out my Switch during these hours.

## Lifting of Lockdown in Taiwan

**ðŸ¤” Confused?**
While Taiwan never really had an "official" lockdown notice, everyone pretty
much remained home whenever possible when the COVID-19 safety level was
risen to level 3 some time around May. When the threat level was raised all
the way to level 3, it means no dining in is allowed and everyone is
encouraged to stay at home unless necessary. <br/>Therefore, whenever I use
the word "lockdown," take the word with a grain of salt if you are from
another region or country, as the definition may or may not match your
expectations or definition.
